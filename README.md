“Developed a Fake Job Detection system using NLP and Machine Learning to identify scam job postings. Built an end-to-end pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and RandomForestClassifier, and deployed an interactive Streamlit web app to classify job posts as real or suspicious based on text analysis and rule-based keyword detection.”
